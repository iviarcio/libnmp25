# NMP Runtime Library 2.5

This repository contains additional objects to link with the NMP bundle object 
produced by Glow.

- A LLVM backend generates a bundle with external calls to functions which are not part
of LIBJIT. For example this is the case for NMP runtime library which are pre-compiled
with GCC compiler than Clang (the one used by default by Glow) for toolchain dependence.

- This means that the bundle generated by Glow is not self contained and requires the
  respective library/objects to be provided at link time.

##  Runtime Library & Bootstrap:

- There is one library and two object files that must be linked with the bundle produced
by the Glow. The NMP runtime library itself called *liblne.a**. The other objects are one
bootstrap that call the main function in C, **crt0.o**, and the last one an specific stdlib.o
